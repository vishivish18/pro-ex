=======================


**Live Demo**: http://themeanmachine.herokuapp.com  

A boilerplate for **MEAN** web applications.

I have been a JS lover since I started programming and the **MEAN Stack** gave me more reasons to love it. I have done many of my
freelancing projects using the MEAN stack and have been using more or less the same project structure for all . Lately I realized 
the need to clean out the mess and prepare a solid skeleton structure for my projects. Now I am extending it further to prepare a
boilerplate to start building MEAN apps with ease. This is my small effort to give back to the Opensource community which has given
me a lot. 




When I started this project, my primary focus was to have a clean and simple skeletion ready for scaling.
Now I am trying to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible so that you can easily write your awesome apps on top of it.
I will add my learnings on the way and will try to use code as documentation.
